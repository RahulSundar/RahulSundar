### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am [Rahul Sundar](https://in.linkedin.com/in/rahul-sundar-311a6977), a MS/PHD scholar in the [Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Madras](http://www.ae.iitm.ac.in/index.htm). I am a research assistant in the [Biomimetics and Dynamics lab](https://github.com/biomimetics-iitm) at IIT Madras under [Prof Sunetra Sarkar](https://home.iitm.ac.in/sunetra/). 

I am passionate about studying forward and inverse Fluid Structure Interaction problems as they offer me the opportunity to go deep and wide in different interconnected topics mentioned below:
- Mathematical Modeling and analysis
- Multiphysical models
- High Performance Computing
- Nonlinear Dynamics
- Model Order Reduction
- System Identification
- Data driven methods for modeling, simulation and control
- Machine Learning
- Stochastic processes and dynamical systems

Currently, I am involved in studying flapping wing flyers in the context of the nonlinear dynamical phenomenon exhibited by the fluid-structure interactions in different regimes of flight and their associated aerodynamic performance.
